# Food-Hunt
Food Hunt is a Django and MySQL-based web application that helps students find nearby restaurants and home kitchens offering lunch/dinner menus. It categorizes providers as dine-in or preorder (3 hrs prior), allows menu browsing, student feedback, likes/dislikes, and uses Firebase for OTP login.
